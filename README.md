# rusthello

Simple rust app to use playing with Codespaces

## Explorations

Added a couple things new (to me) for this repo. Nothing spectacular.

### devcontainer for Codespace

Created a devcontainer.json with assist from the VS Code extension using the bullseye image that includes Rust tool-chain.

Set two extensions (GitHub.copilot and rust-lang-rust-analyzer) to be included in the Codespace VS Code.

### GitHub workflow

Added the default workflow for Rust...need to go read more about workflows.
